Q.
N  line segments (numbered 1 through N) are placed on the x-axis. For each valid i, the i-th segment starts at x=Li and ends at x=Ri.

At the time t=0, all segments start moving; for each valid i, the i-th segment starts moving with speed Vi. You need to assign a direction - left or right - to the movement of each segment, i.e. choose a sign for each Vi (not necessarily the same for all segments). The resulting movement must satisfy the following condition: at the time t=1010000, there are no two segments that touch or intersect.

Decide if it is possible to assign directions to the segments in such a way that the above condition is satisfied.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
N lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers Li, Ri and Vi.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to assign the directions in a valid way or "NO" if it is impossible.

Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤1,000
1≤Li<Ri≤109 for each valid i
1≤Vi≤109 for each valid i
the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2,000

Example Output
YES
NO
Explanation
Example case 1: We can assign the direction left to the 1-st and 2-nd segment and right to the 3-rd and 4-th segment.

Example case 2: There is no valid way to assign directions to segments.

                    flag=False
                    direction[i] = 1 - direction[i]
